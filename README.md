# SWE Projects

Welcome to my **Software Engineering projects** repository! This repository contains all the projects and tasks I am completing while learning web development following the [Backend Developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend/projects) on roadmap.sh. Each directory corresponds to a specific task or mini-project in the roadmap.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder represents a task or project.
- Inside each folder, you will find the implementation files, notes, and any relevant resources.
- The structure is designed to help track progress and serve as a reference for learning.

## Goals

- Practice and apply web development concepts from the roadmap.
- Build a portfolio of projects demonstrating my learning journey.
- Maintain organized and documented code for each task.

The roadmap that guides these projects can be found here: [Backend Developer Roadmap on roadmap.sh](hhttps://roadmap.sh/backend/projects)
